	To install:
The install.sh script is not executable, so you have to type this in a terminal:
"cd /wherever/youplaced/thefolder"
"chmod +x install.sh"
Now, run install.sh
"sudo bash install.sh"
DELETE THE FOLDER THAT YOU FOUND INSTALL.SH!
This is VERY IMPORTANT!  If you do not delete it, you risk running install.sh again, and having a duplicate of the Notification Maker.
